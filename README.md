## 🧱 Architecture Overview

This project is structured into three main layers:

### 1. Presentation Layer (`FirstAppWith_ThreeTierArchitecture`)
- Handles user input and output
- Interacts with the Business Logic Layer
- Decoupled from data access concerns

### 2. Business Logic Layer (BLL)
- Contains core application logic
- Acts as a bridge between UI and Data layers
- Ensures business rules are enforced

### 3. Data Access Layer (DAL)
- Responsible for communicating with the database
- Handles CRUD operations and data persistence
- Isolated from business and presentation logic
